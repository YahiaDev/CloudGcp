# spring google cloud platform
springgcpgradle and springgcpmvn are two spring boot apps, vue-gcp-demo is a vuejs app. The first one is managed by maven and the second one with gradle.
The idea was two deploy those apps on Google cloud platform app engine using app engine pluguin for maven and gradle.

vue-gcp-demo is a web app that display a list of books. For the more we can add new books to the list. The app can be deployed 
in GCP app engine and interact with springgcpgradle app that is deployed on other app engine service.
